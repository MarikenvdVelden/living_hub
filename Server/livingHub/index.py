"""
Encapsulates elasticsearch indices  and provides authorisation through user roles

Authorisation rules:
- There are 5 increasing levels of authorisation: None, metareader, reader, writer, admin
- Users can have a global role and a role on any index. Every index can also have a guest role
- Global roles:
  - Writers can create new projects and users (with at most their own global role)
  - Admins can delete projects and assign themselves a role on any index role
- Index roles:
  - None means an index cannot be viewed or accessed in any way (the index is invisible to the user)
  - Metareader means the user can read all properties, do queries, etc., but cannot read the 'text' attribute
    (this is mostly intended to provide access to metadata fields of copyrighted material)
  - Reader can read all properties, do queries, etc., but cannot make changes
  - Writers can add/delete documents, add/delete users (up to their own level), and make other changes (but not delete)
  - Admins can do whatever they want, including deleting the index
- If a user does not have an explicit role on an index, the guest role (if any) is used
- An unauthorized user can still get guest roles, so it can see any indices with a guest role

Note that these rules are not enforced in this module, they should be enforced by the API!
